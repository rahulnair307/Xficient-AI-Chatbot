# Xficient-AI-Chatbot

Recieved First Place in Bitcamp 2024 Hackathon for University Course Catalog Data Extraction and Query Challenge sponsored by Xficient.

Created an AI Chat-Bot harnessing unsupervised learning to cluster data in uploaded pdfs. Seamlessly integrated the GPT API through Lang Chain, providing intuitive access to course info. Used Python and StreamLit for Front-End. The input PDFs judged with were the 868-page Virginia Tech 2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog and Academic Policies

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the complexities of integrating machine learning algorithms with natural language processing technologies. I also honed skills in optimizing algorithms for scalability and performance. Most importantly, I learned how to plan large projects and work with data handling in a contraint amount of time. Looking ahead, we plan to enhance Xficient Bot by integrating Milvus database for faster processing and greater accuracy.
