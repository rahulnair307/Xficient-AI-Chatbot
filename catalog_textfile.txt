Undergraduate Course Descriptions (REAL)
Overview
The Program in Real Estate is administratively housed in Pamplin College of Business. The B.S. in Real
Estate is a comprehensive, interdisciplinary academic program that draws classes from five colleges ( College
of Agriculture and Life Sciences , College of Architecture and Urban Studies , Pamplin College of
Business , College of Engineering , and College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences ) to students with
dynamic education.
The Program in Real Estate offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Real Estate. Real Estate courses integrate
the material students learn in disciplinary courses such as finance, law, and property management through
practical experiences within the academic program. The integration occurs though a university-industry
partnership where real estate professionals are actively involved in students' education through guest lectures,
mentoring experiences, and by providing internship opportunities.
In addition to learning about the broad field of real estate, students are encouraged to find their niche in the
field. Students develop an area of expertise to fulfill their restricted electives requirement. This is
accomplished by adding a second major, completing a minor, or creating an area of concentration (with the

Africana Studies Program
Director:  Ellington Graves
Professors:  O. Agozino and W. Reed
Gloria Smith Endowed Professor:  K. Harrison (Africana Studies/Sociology)
Associate Professors:  K. Harrison (Africana Studies/Sociology), P. Polanah, and P. Seniors
Affiliated Faculty:  R. Briggs (Political Science), N. Giovanni (English), B. Faulkner (Political Science), A.
Few (Human Development), V. Fowler (English), C. Gitre (History), E. Graves (Sociology), M. Heaton

Africana Studies is an interdisciplinary field of study that uses concepts and methodologies of the Social
Sciences and the Humanities, centering on the study of peoples of African descent. The program
cooperates with faculty from across the university, whose teaching and research is concerned with Africa
and the African diaspora. Africana Studies engages with other programs and organizations in community
awareness activities that celebrate the richness and diversity of African diasporic cultures and traditions.
An Africana Studies minor is open to all students who are interested in learning about the experiences of
Africans and people of African descent.
American Indian Studies: A Holistic Approach
Director:  Samuel R. Cook
Associate Professor:  S. Cook
Assistant Professor:  N. Copeland
A program in the Department of Sociology, we offer several courses and a minor in American Indian
Studies.
We believe that any successful American Indian Studies program must do more than simply educate a
general student body on American Indian cultures and issues in a sensitive way. We believe that our
curricula must exist in conjunction with all university programs pertinent to American Indians, and must
depend on the impetus of indigenous peoples working within and beyond the university.
In keeping with Virginia Tech's status and mission as a land grant institution, we strive to serve our
indigenous constituency, both as educators and as partners. Accordingly, our program serves as a vital
conduit for university-tribal relations, the recruitment and retention of American Indian students and
faculty, and Service-Learning initiatives in indigenous communities. Although our program has a regional
focus, we offer a wide spectrum of courses--ranging from American Indian Literatures, American Indian
Spirituality, and American Indian Arts, to native Peoples of the Southeast, American Indians in Film, and
Global indigenous Rights--reflecting the impressive and diverse expertise of our faculty.
In short, we embrace a holistic, collaborative approach to American Indian Studies in which university
faculty and students develop and maintain meaningful partnerships. Accordingly, we maintain a tribaladvisory board consisting of elders and leaders from all of Virginia's eight Indian Nations. We regardthese representatives, and ultimately, all indigenous peoples as our colleagues.

The field of Women's and Gender Studies (WGS) transforms traditional disciplines through new methods
and theories generated by feminist scholarship. The Women's and Gender Studies Program is housed in
the Department of Sociology and includes teaching faculty and affiliates from across the entire campus.
WGS affiliated faculty contribute to the program through their research, student advising, participation in
governance, and teaching. Women's and Gender Studies 1824 is a pathways course. Our program also
offers courses for all students in the university, including four in Area 2 of the Curriculum for Liberal
Education (WGS 1824, WGS 2224, WGS 2244, and WGS 2254), one in Area 3 (WGS 2264), and one in
Area 7 (WGS 3214). Students interested in WGS may select from two minors, Women's and Gender
Studies, and Gender, Science, and Technology. The degree option and minors are interdisciplinary,
cross-cultural programs of study in which students cultivate an understanding of the complex ways that
gender is defined and contested in social structures, history, culture, and technology. They offer students
new ways of thinking about how gender, race/ethnicity, class, and sexuality shape social institutions and
cultural beliefs as well as personal experiences and perceptions. Central to the mission of the Women's
and Gender Studies Program is the empowerment of a diverse population of women within local, regional,
national, and global contexts.
Students interested in learning more about the Women's & Gender Studies program should contact theprogram director, Sharon Johnson at spjohnso@vt.eduA graduate certificate in Women's and Gender Studies is also available. See the Graduate Catalog .
Center For Peace Studies and Violence Prevention
Director:  James Hawdon
The Center for Peace Studies and Violence Prevention is a student-center, multi-disciplinary undertaking
to promote research, education and outreach in the area of peace studies and violence prevention. Since
its inception in 2008, the Center has adopted three thematic areas:The prevention of violencePeace studiesThe development of new leaders for this century
The Center is a hub for research and pedagogy on peace studies and violence prevention. Our
multidisciplinary approach allows students, faculty, and a variety of off-campus constituents to address
peace building and violence prevention in a holistic manner.
The Center for Peace Studies offers a minor in Peace Studies. The minor is designed to provide students
with a broad perspective on violence prevention and peace building. Students minoring in Peace Studies
will be required to take two core courses, Peace and Violence as Critical Incidents (PSVP 2044) and
Global Society, Violence and the Prospects for Peace (PSVP 4104). In addition, students will select four
elective courses from a variety of courses that focus on either "local" issues of violence prevention and
peace building or "global" issues of violence prevention and peace building.
Center for Race & Social Policy
Director:  Wornie Reed
The Center for Race and Social Policy (RSP), presently a College Center, was formed in April 2001 as a
University Center to fulfill two primary goals: (1) to conduct and disseminate original research in the area
of public policy with a direct emphasis on race and ethnicity; and (2) to prepare promising graduate
students to think and speak critically, plan quality research, and contribute to public-policy discussions
related to race and ethnicity.
The Center promotes a broad and inclusive concept of race and ethnicity, which includes African
Americans, American Indians, Asian Americans, European Americans, Latinos, and bi-racial and multi-
racial identities. RSP research projects involve the development and evaluation of public policy across
different racial and ethnic contexts and within myriad public policy venues, including welfare,
employment, education, and health as well as community outreach.

Academic PoliciesMenuStatistics courses are offered at both the undergraduate and the graduate levels for students preparingfor professions in statistics, for students who need statistical tools to engage in scientific research, and for
students who want to acquire knowledge of the important concepts of probability and statistical inference.
Statistics courses for graduate students and programs leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in statistics
are described in the Graduate Catalog  and in a special bulletin available from the department.
Bachelor of Science in Statistics
All statistics majors are required to own specified personal computers and software. Consult the
department for details.
A special brochure describing the department and the B.S. program, intended for prospective entering
freshmen, is available from the department upon request.
Cooperative Education and Internship positions are available in industry and government, offering
valuable practical experience. Students participating in such an experience can receive academic credit
which will count towards graduation requirements.
Degree Requirements
The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree
requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for
graduation are referred to via university publications as "Checksheets". The number of credit hours
required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all
requirements and university obligations for degree completion.
The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will
not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a
transition plan for students already in the degree program.
Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-
brief/index1.html  for degree requirements.
Minor in Statistics
Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-
brief/index1.html  to view requirements for the minor.
The department reserves the right to withhold credit if a student takes a course, the content of which is
partially duplicated in a course already taken (see "Course Duplications" below).
The Statistical Applications and Innovations Group
Associated with the Department, the Statistical Applications and Innovations Group (SAIG) provides
assistance for research projects to participating members of the University community and outside
organizations. Statistics Department faculty members and students collaborate to design studies, analyze
data, and interpret results for Virginia Tech affiliated clients and external clients in business, industry,
government, and non-profit organizations. SAIG provides both experiential learning for statistics students
and service to the University and beyond. To learn more, visit https://saig.stat.vt.edu/ .
Satisfactory Progress
University policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet
minimum criteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see " Academics ")
and toward the degree.Satisfactory progress requirements toward the B.S. in Statistics can be found on the major checksheet by
visiting the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html .
Course DuplicationsNo credit will be given for 2004 if taken with or after any other statistics course, except STAT 2984.For non-majors, all of the following are partial duplications: 3005, 3604, 3615, 4604, and 4705.For majors, 4604 and 4705 may replace 3005 if taken before becoming a major.All the following are partial duplications: 3006, 3616, and 4706.No credit will be given for 3704 if taken after any of the following: 3005, 3615, 4604, and 4705.BIT 2405 may not be used as a substitute for credit as a statistics course unless the student was
officially registered as a Business major at the time BIT 2405 was taken.
Computer Literacy
Many statistics courses involve the use of statistics software, primarily MINITAB, SAS, JMP or R.
Experience with the software is not expected, but students should have familiarity with either the
Windows or Macintosh operating system and have access to a computer.
Course Projects
Many of the upper-division courses include a project, generally to be completed in small groups. These
projects are designed to give students the kind of insight and experience in realistic statistical practice
that cannot be obtained in classroom lectures or short-term homework assignments.

Overview
The Systems Biology program is a joint effort of the departments of Biological Sciences, Physics,
Chemistry, Mathematics and Computer Science. The program resides in, and is organized as a division
of, the College of Science's Academy of Integrated Science.
A "systems approach" to biology involves the study of the biological, chemical, and physical processes
within living organisms as they interact in complex ways to produce life-supporting behaviors. The Virginia
Tech program in Systems Biology focuses on the powerful, emerging paradigm of molecular systems
biology, i.e., on computational, systems-level approaches that connect the biochemical and genetic
properties of individual macromolecules (DNA, RNA, protein, lipids, polysaccharides) with the
physiological behavior of living cells and tissues. These levels of biological organization, which comprise
the gap between interacting macromolecules and cell physiology, embody an active area of research
producing technological and biomedical innovations. The Systems Biology program bridges the
molecular/cell divide, training students for employment or graduate education in this burgeoning field.

Overview
The Urban Affairs and Planning Program (UAP) offers two undergraduate degrees, the B.A. in public and
urban affairs and the B.S. in environmental policy and planning, as well as minors under both degrees. At
the graduate level the department offers the master of urban and regional planning degree.
B.A. in Public and Urban Affairs
The B.A. in public and urban affairs (PUA) is an interdisciplinary social science degree with a professional
cast. It aims to educate students in the liberal arts tradition while equipping them with the skills,

Academic PoliciesMenuknowledge, and analytical thinking used in planning and policy. Students learn to address the political,economic, environmental, social, and governmental consequences of growth and change and to help
resolve the problems that emanate from them.
B.S. in Environmental Policy and Planning
The B.S. in environmental policy and planning (EPP) provides students the opportunity to study
environmental problems and their solutions from an interdisciplinary perspective involving humanities,
natural and social science, planning, and public policy. While rooted in scientific and technological fields,
environmental problems and their solutions increasingly deal with public values, economics, law, policy,
and planning. The EPP curriculum, while providing a broad liberal arts and natural and social science
base, has a pre-professional slant involving analytical and communication skills and policy and planning
methods to prepare students for employment and graduate study.
Degree Requirements
The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree
requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for
graduation are referred to via university publications as "Checksheets". The number of credit hours
required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all
requirements and university obligations for degree completion.
The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will
not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a
transition plan for students already in the degree program.
Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-
brief/index1.html  for degree requirements.
Satisfactory Progress
University policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet
minimum criteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see " Academics ")
and toward the degree in Urban Affairs and Planning.
